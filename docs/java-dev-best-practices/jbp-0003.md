title: Don't float dependency versions
---

{% include links.md %}

Dependencies are developed by developers who work with different philosophies to our own when it comes to breaking changes, release schedules, and so on. Build tooling almost universally has support for specifying a dependency with a fixed version value, or a range of allowed versions. Fortunately the Java ecosystem has by and large settled on always having each dependency be a single fixed version.

The argument for fixing a single dependency version is clear: we want reproducible builds of our applications, and when a dependency may change beneath our feet between builds of our application, we can have little faith that our application will continue to work without a lot of testing. It is better to remove this variable from our build process, and to therefore only move dependencies when the timing is right for us. This might be at the start of a development cycle, following a release of our Java code when we have time to thoroughly test our dependencies. This is a good time to follow the guidance in [JPB-4](/JPB-4), to keep dependencies up to date.
