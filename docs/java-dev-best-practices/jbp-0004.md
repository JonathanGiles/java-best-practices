title: Keep dependencies up to date
---

{% include links.md %}

Despite the guidance to [minimize dependencies](/JBP-2), it is inevitable that most projects will have multiple dependencies. It is good practice to always work to keep these libraries up to date. Updating to newer versions protects against security vulnerabilities, and often brings new features, performance improvements, and bug fixes. Tracking dependencies manually can be quite burdensome, so fortunately there are tools that make our lives easier.

Before we begin, it is worth reiterating that the burden of dependency versioning should ideally be limited to [BOM files only](/JBP-1), as this drastically reduces the number of dependency versions we actually care about in our project. When we update a BOM, all of the referenced dependencies within that BOM are updated to newer versions, with the added benefit that we can have a higher degree of confidence in the transitive closure of all dependencies, which should result in greater compatibility and lower likelihood of diamond dependency problems.

With that out of the way, we can now decide to investigate our dependencies locally, or defer it to automated services. We will cover both below.
