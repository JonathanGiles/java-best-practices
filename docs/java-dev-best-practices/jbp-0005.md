title: Make use of logging APIs

{% include links.md %}

Having a good logging story in all Java applications can be a real lifesaver when something goes wrong. The challenge is learning what to log and how to use the logging frameworks to their full potential to spread log output across the numerous logging levels (e.g. info, verbose, warning, etc), as well as to not impact the performance of the application with all the extra logging code.

Java has a plethora of logging frameworks, so it can often be confusing how to get started, but it is important to make a start so as to not be caught flat-footed when logging could have been useful.
