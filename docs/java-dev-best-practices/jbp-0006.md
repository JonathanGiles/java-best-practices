{% include links.md %}

The Java ecosystem has created a lot of very useful build tools, the most popular being Maven and Gradle. Projects using these build tools are fortunate to have a good number of plugins that enable static code analysis and other kinds of project validation. These plugins can provide great insights into issues with your project, so it is worthwhile spending time enabling these plugins and ensuring that they are configured properly.
