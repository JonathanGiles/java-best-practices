title: Configure build plugins
---

{% include links.md %}

The Java ecosystem has created a lot of very useful build tools, the most popular being Maven and Gradle. Projects using these build tools are fortunate to have a good number of plugins that enable static code analysis and other kinds of project validation. These plugins can provide great insights into issues with your project, so it is worthwhile spending time enabling these plugins and ensuring that they are configured properly.

## SpotBugs

[SpotBugs](https://spotbugs.github.io/) is a great tool for finding bugs in code through static analysis. It integrates well into Maven and Gradle and can generate extremely useful reports about the quality of a codebase. 

The SpotBugs project publishes short documents that detail how to integrate SpotBugs [into Maven](https://spotbugs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/maven.html) and [into Gradle](https://spotbugs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gradle.html). Once integrated into the build process for your project, the next step is calling the appropriate build targets to generate a human-readable HTML report. Taking it to the extreme, it is possible to fail builds if a SpotBugs issue is encountered, and this has proven to be useful in projects at Microsoft to ensure code quality remains high (especially if the CI build runs before a commit can be merged into the main repo).
