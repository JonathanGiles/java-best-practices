title: Use the latest Java long-term support release
---

{% include links.md %}

New Java releases are made every six months, with some versions designated as 'long-term support' (or LTS). These LTS releases are made every three years, with the most recent LTS releases being Java 11 and Java 17 in September 2018 and September 2021.

Nonâ€‘LTS releases are considered a cumulative set of implementation enhancements of the most recent LTS release. These are good releases to test with, so that you can have higher degrees of confidence that moving to the next LTS will be straightforward, but you should avoid using non-LTS releases in production.

## Which build of Java should I use?

Java releases used to be simple - you'd download a build for a particular operating system from the Sun Microsystems website, and that was it. Today, because of the fact the OpenJDK is open source, numerous companies make available builds of the OpenJDK that are all equivalent. Some companies also offer enhanced builds of OpenJDK that offer improved performance, security, or other enhancements.

If your needs are simple and you do not require any form of support, any build of OpenJDK will be sufficient. Common choices include:

* [Oracle's OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/)
* [Eclipse Temurin](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/adoptium.temurin) (formerly AdoptOpenJDK)
* [Microsoft's OpenJDK](https://www.microsoft.com/openjdk)
* [Azul Zulu](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?package=jdk)

If you are looking for a supported offering, your best choice is to choose a build from your cloud provider, such as the [Microsoft OpenJDK build](https://www.microsoft.com/openjdk), as these will offer the best integration and support options for you and your cloud of choice.
