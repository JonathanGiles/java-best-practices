title: Release to Maven Central
---

{% include links.md %}

[Maven Central](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/) is *the* place where developers go to get Java libraries, and it is where any library that a user is expected to use should be uploaded. Requiring users to retrieve a dependency from a different location requires them to manually introduce new configuration into their project files to specify this new location, and there is rarely an argument for introducing this additional friction.

It's important to note that Maven Central is not just for the Maven build tool - build tools such as Gradle also know how to look up dependencies in Maven Central.

Being the primary location for Java artifacts, Maven Central has many mirrors. This reduces the likelihood of a dependency becoming unavailable due to a single point of failure.

Unless there is a very good reason to not distribute via Maven Central, this should be the default means of releasing artifacts to the world.
