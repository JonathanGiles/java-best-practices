title: Resist breaking changes

{% include links.md %}

As a developer there is nothing more frustrating than something breaking, whether it be our computer hardware, our network connection, the software we rely on to communicate and work, or the dependencies we rely on to build our software. When things break, our productivity grinds to a halt and we are forced to spend time getting things working again.

When it comes to breaking APIs, we should strive to do this as rarely as possible, so that we don't create unnecessary work on our users. In fact, our baseline expectation should be to never break our API, and only to allow it in exceptional situations. At the point we need to break, we then need to [follow semantic versioning rules](/JLBP-5).

Further best practices are outlined in the [characteristics of good API](/JLBP-1) guidance are related to evolvability, as well as in the [design for exensibility](/JLBP-9).
