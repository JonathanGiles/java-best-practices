title: Eat your own dogfood

{% include links.md %}

As API developers we have to be careful that the API we are creating is indeed useful for its stated purpose. We have to have developer empathy to look through the eyes of the developer, rather than as ourselves. It is far too easy for us to take our extremely detailed understanding of the problem our API tries to solve with us when we start to test our APIs.

The best way to be assured of this is to '[eat your own dogfood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food)'. In other words, it is important to ensure that the API is used throughout its development, by yourself, but more importantly, by trusted 'real world' users.

The value of bringing in 'real world' users is to help prevent ourselves from losing our sense of restraint, and adding enhancements based solely on our advanced understanding of the API. 'Real world' users help to balance this, to ensure we only fix what is considered truly broken.

When we write applications using our API, we should use this time to look for code that does not work cleanly (or with unclear intentions), places where there is duplicate or redundant code, and places where our API forces the developer to work at a level of abstraction that is either too low-level or too high-level.
